       Hi, how are you? I hope you are fine.
        
        Here are the questions that you can ask:
        
        1. Can you tell me the most demanded sector?
        2. Tell me the statistics found.
        3. Can you tell me the frequency of the number of likes?
        4. What is the model that you will use to predict the number of likes for each sector?
        5. I want to know the number of likes of the domain and tell me the name of the domain.
        6. Can you tell me the value of MSE, please?
        7. Can you give me all the MSE of all models?
        8. From which website did you extract all this information?
        9. Can you give me the figure using the linear regression model?
